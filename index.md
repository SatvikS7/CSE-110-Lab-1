```hello o/```
I am a 2nd year Computer Science major currently getting my BS at UCSD. Hopefully, you learn more about me [as a programmer](#as-a-programmer) and [as a person](#as-a-person). 
## As a Programmer
As a programmer I love going into a bunch of different new and old disciplines like:
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Graph Theory
- Optimization

This inturn made me have an affinity to languages such as **Python, C++,** and **Java**.


>"Live with a purpose" - me <sub>(and probably other people)</sub>
## As a Person
Outside of my major, I love to engage in mainly physical activities. Things like calisthenics and [bouldering](https://www.boulderbrighton.com/what-is-bouldering#:~:text=Bouldering%20is%20rock%20climbing%20stripped,%2C%20strength%2C%20and%20your%20brain.). When I am not doing either of these things, I occasionally enjoy baking either [bread](CSE-110-pages\IMG_2438.jpg) or various pastries. Some things that I want to accomplish within the next 5 years are: 
- [ ] Travel outside the country alone or with friends
- [ ] Have a stable job
- [ ] Live in my own apartment or home
- [ ] Be able to cook without recipes
